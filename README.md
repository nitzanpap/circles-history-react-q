# React Challenge

Create a web page using react, that by clicking the screen, it creates a circle in the clicked coordinate on the screen.
Add two buttons:

- Backwards: Retraces the steps, and removes the created circles by history order.
- Forwards: Adds back circles that were created but were removed from the screen due to the backwards button.
